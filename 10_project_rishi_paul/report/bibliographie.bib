  abstract   = {Consider the following abstract coin tossing problem: Given a set of n coins with unknown biases, find the most biased coin using a minimal number of coin tosses. This is a common abstraction of various exploration problems in theoretical computer science and machine learning and has been studied extensively over the years. In particular, algorithms with optimal sample complexity (number of coin tosses) have been known for this problem for quite some time. Motivated by applications to processing massive datasets, we study the space complexity of solving this problem with optimal number of coin tosses in the streaming model. In this model, the coins are arriving one by one and the algorithm is only allowed to store a limited number of coins at any point – any coin not present in the memory is lost and can no longer be tossed or compared to arriving coins. Prior algorithms for the coin tossing problem with optimal sample complexity are based on iterative elimination of coins which inherently require storing all the coins, leading to memory-inefficient streaming algorithms. We remedy this state-of-affairs by presenting a series of improved streaming algorithms for this problem: we start with a simple algorithm which require storing only O(logn) coins and then iteratively refine it further and further, leading to algorithms with O(loglog(n)) memory, O((n)) memory, and finally a one that only stores a single extra coin in memory – the same exact space needed to just store the best coin throughout the stream. Furthermore, we extend our algorithms to the problem of finding the k most biased coins as well as other exploration problems such as finding top-k elements using noisy comparisons or finding an -best arm in stochastic multi-armed bandits, and obtain efficient streaming algorithms for these problems.},

  year        = {2018},
  abstract    = {Exits with obstacles facilitate evacuations under specific circumstances. In order to quickly and efficiently find these circumstances, crowd simulations can be used. In this study, a particle based crowd simulation is used to find evacuation scenarios where obstacles facilitate evacuation. The scenarios used are based on data from experiments with real people performed by PHD student Daichi Yanagisawa.     The results show that scenarios where obstacles hamper evacuation for real people, also hamper evacuation for simulated people. No scenario was found where obstacles facilitated evacuations. The conclusion of the study is that particle based simulations of crowds can help find scenarios where obstacles do not facilitate evacuations. A simulation system that is better at recreating human behaviour in evacuation situations is required to find setups where obstacles can actively facilitate evacuation.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel approach to simulate virtual human crowds in emergency situations. Our model is based on two previous works, on a physical model proposed by Helbing, where individuals are represented by a particle system affected by "social forces" that impels them to go to a point-objective, while avoiding collisions with obstacles and other agents. As a new property, the virtual agents are endowed with different attributes and individualities as proposed by Braun et al. The main contributions of this paper are the treatment of complex environments and their implications on agents' movement, the management of alarms distributed in space, the virtual agents endowed with perception of emergency events and their consequent reaction as well as changes in their individualities. The prototype reads a XML file where different scenarios can be simulated, such as the characteristics of population, the virtual scene description, the alarm configuration and the properties of hazardous events. As output, the prototype generates information in order to measure the impact of parameters on saved, injured and dead agents. In addition, some results and validation are discussed.},
