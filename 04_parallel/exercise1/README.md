# Dask Dashboard Overview
This contains some videos of the Dask Dashboard from the Dask-Parallelization of Multiple Simulations of the Wildfire Burning implementation. This was recorded on a 2021
M1 Macbook Pro (16''), which has 10 cores. The default configuration for the `Client()` form `dask.distributed` were used, which on the aforementioned system was 
**5 workers, each with 2 threads**. The recordings below are from running 5 simulations in parallel using `dask.delayed` and the method described in the report.
