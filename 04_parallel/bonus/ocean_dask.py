    Similar to the `run_simulation_default` function in `ocean_default.py`, but uses DASK AWESOMENESS :)  

    deterministic: Is to be set to True if we want the final result to be consistent across multiple calls.
                   This sets the seed for the initial grid values in the experiment. Defaults to False.
    
    profile_time:  Is to be set to True if we want to measure the time (in seconds) of the main loop that 
                   SCHEDULES the ocean updates in a loop, and the final compute() call that does the computations of the 
                   generated task graph. Note that only the main loop is timed, so the time of initialization of 
                   grids is not considered here. If set to True, then no print statements are generated. 

    num_iters:     The numer of times the ocean is to be updated. Defaults to TIME_STEPS defined above in the file.

    chunk_size:    The size of chunk to use for the dask arrays. Defaults to tO CHUNK_SIZE in this file

    num_workers:   The number of workers to be used by the dask.distributed Client. Defaults to NUM_WORKERS at the top of this file.

    Returns the velocity vector (x and y directions, separately), and the temperature. If the profile_time is True, then the
    time is returned (in seconds) as the 4th value. Otherwise, the 4th value is 0.
