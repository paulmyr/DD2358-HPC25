# Dask Dashboard Data
Here, we present video recordings for observations of our Dask Dashboard that we spoke about in the report. The aim of these recordings here is to provide more context for our conclusions drawn 
in the report, so that the reader can see the evolution of parameters (such as worker memory usage, job status, etc) for themselves.

## Worker Memory and CPU Usage (for Different Chunk Sizes)
Below, we provide video recordings of the `Worker` tab of the Dask Dashboard. Of partcicular interest to us, according to the assignment handout, were the **CPU Usage** and the **Memory Usage**
of each of the 5 workers. We provide recordings for the `Worker` tab for different chunk sizes below. Only the recordings are provided here. Please refer to the report for our conclusions and to read us
talk more about these observations.

## Job Status (for Different Chunk Sizes)
Below, we provide video recordings for the `Progress` tab (available from under the `More...` tab in the default Dask Dashboard screen). Information on what this tab displays can be found [here](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/dashboard.html#progress).
We utilized the information from this tab to note if there were any `queued` tasks. Again, we request you to refer to the report where we do a brief discussion of the observations here.
