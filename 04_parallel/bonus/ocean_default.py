    Runs the ocean currents simulation. 

    deterministic: Is to be set to True if we want the final result to be consistent across multiple calls.

                   updates the ocean in a loop. Note that only the main loop is timed, so the time of initialization of 
                   grids is not considered here. If set to True, then no print statements are generated and output is not
                   saved to any VTK files.

    num_iters:     The numer of times the ocean is to be updated. Defaults to TIME_STEPS defined above in the file.
                   NOTE: SHOULD BE A MULTIPLE OF 10 TO KEEP WITH NEATNESSS :) 

    Returns the velocity vector (x and y directions, separately), and the temperature. If the profile_time is True, then the
