# Original vs Optimized
Below, you can see the visual difference between the original implementation of the "Game of Life", and the Optimized version implemented by us. The `python3 conway.py` on the left runs the original implementation, while the `python3 conway_improved.py` on the right runs the optimized implementation.

For more information on how this was done, refer to the **Bonus: Game of Life** section of the report!
